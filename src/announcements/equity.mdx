## Equity Initative

We, the Robototes, are outraged by institutional racism against the black community in our country. We feel it is our obligation to fight to end racism and the injustices it brings. We will not stay silent.

To learn more about how we are working to promote equity and inclusivity on our team, you can visit our [Equity Initative](/outreach/equity-initiative) page.
