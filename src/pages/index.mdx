# The Robototes

## Who are we?

We are the Robototes, [Sammamish High School](https://bsd405.org/sammamish)'s FIRST Robotics team. We have participated in [FRC](https://firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) (FIRST Robotics Competition) since 2008.

## Our Mission:

To provide all members with the opportunity to grow and learn as leaders, learners and innovators, all while growing interest in STEM in our community.

## What do we do?

As well as participate in FRC, we also spread the mission of FIRST in our community. We hold and participate in Outreach events at local organizations ([Bellevue Arts Museum](https://bellevuearts.org)), schools in [BSD](https://bsd405.org) and [Crossroads Community Center](https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/parks/community-centers/crossroads).
