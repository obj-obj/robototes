# What is FIRST?

The Robototes compete within the organization FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). FIRST is a national organization dedicated to helping students discover the magic of science and technology. The Robototes compete through FRC.

# What is FRC?

FIRST has several programs, including FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), a high-school level program where different teams (including us) compete and cooperate with each other. Students also learn skills such as fundraising, creating a cohesive brand, and volunteering in their communities.

Every year we receive a [new challenge, or game](https://youtu.be/EMiNmJW7enI). These games can range from [basketball](https://youtu.be/nOXsdhZZSdM) and [shooting Frisbees](https://youtu.be/wa5MGEZNrf0) to hanging large inner tubes on pegs over 7 feet in the air. After the game is revealed, we only have six weeks and a few days to work on the robot. These six weeks are known as "Build Season". After Build Season, our team goes to competitions, where many different teams compete and work together to win matches and awards.

	In INFINITE RECHARGE, two alliances work to protect FIRST City from approaching asteroids caused by a distant space skirmish. Each Alliance, along with their trusty droids, race to collect and score Power Cells in order to energize their Shield Generator for maximum protection. To activate stages of the Shield Generator, droids manipulate their Control Panels after scoring a specific number of Power Cells. Near the end of the match, droids race to their Rendezvous Point to get their Shield Generator operational in order to protect the city!

	It involves two alliances of three teams each, with each team controlling a robot and performing specific tasks on a field to score points. The game centers around an outer space theme involving two alliances consisting of three teams each competing to place poly-carbonate hatch panels and orange rubber balls or "cargo" on rockets and cargo ships before returning to their HAB platform to climb at the end of the match.

		It involves two alliances of three teams each, with each team controlling a robot and performing specific tasks on a field to score points. The game has a retro 8-bit theme and teams are required to place milk crafts, or "power cubes", on large balancing scales to tip the scale and gain ownership. Alliances can also trade power cubes for power ups, giving them a temporary advantage in a match. At the end of the match, robots can climb the tower attached to the center balancing scale using a rung attached to the tower, giving them additional points.

	</div>
	<div slot="right">
		As in past games, two alliances of three individual teams and their robots compete on a field to score "match" point to win the game and ranking points to advance to playoff rounds. The game has a steampunk theme and teams are required to shoot wiffle balls which represent fuel into a simulated boiler which transfers the generated steam into an airship in the middle of the field. Each alliance has one airship, which they pressurize with steam from the boiler and load with plastic gears from the field. At the end of the match, robots can climb and hang on team-supplied ropes (or standard ropes supplied by FIRST) attached to the airship for additional points.
