	## Who are we? & Our History

	The Robototes, FRC Team 2412, was founded in **2007** at **Sammamish High School** with 12 students and 2 mentors, first competing in 2008. Our first competition was [OverDrive](https://youtu.be/4a9KfpBZ4DQ) and we've been building robots ever since. Our workspace frequently changed until 2015, when 2412 settled in Sammamish's engineering and robotics rooms.

	Since then, **enrollment has tripled** and currently consists of 65 students and 20 mentors. Increasing **female participation** is an ongoing focus for the team, especially for outreach events.

	## More than just robots

	Although building robots is definitely important, we also have many members who are involved in other non-robot aspects, such as Business and [Outreach](/outreach). A good team, which we strive to be, is well-balanced in all areas. Even if you're not into building robots or programming, you can still help! Our team meets at [Sammamish High School](https://bsd405.org/sammamish) in the engineering room (room 143, first floor) after school on Mondays, and 4 days a week during the build season.

	## Best years

	Our most successful seasons were [2008](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2412/2008), [2014](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2412/2014), and [2019](https://thebluealliance.com/team/2412/2019). In those three years, we have won a total of 63 matches (not including the off-season) and received many awards. You can see all of our past competitions at [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2412).
